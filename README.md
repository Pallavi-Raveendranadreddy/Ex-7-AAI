<H1 ALIGN =CENTER>Implementation of Text  Summarization</H1>
<H3>Aim: </H3> 
to perform automatic text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. <BR>
<h3>Algorithm:</h3>

- `Step 1:` Import necessary libraries for natural language processing tasks.<BR>
- `Step 2:` Download NLTK resources, including the punkt tokenizer and stopwords.<BR>
- `Step 3:` Define Text Preprocessing Function to tokenize, remove stopwords, and perform stemming.<BR>
- `Step 4:` Define the Text Summarization Function using a simple frequency-based approach.<br>
    - Calculate the frequency of each word in the preprocessed text.<br>
    - Calculate a score for each sentence based on the sum of word frequencies.<br>
    - Select the top N sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.<br>
- `Step 5:` Construct the main program to read the paragraph  and perform text summarization<br>
    - Generate and print the original text.<br>
    - Generate and print the text summary using the  Text Summarization function<br>

Unlike theoretical AI research, which focuses on advancing the understanding of AI algorithms and methodologies, applied AI involves the deployment of AI solutions to address specific challenges or 
improve existing processes.

Applied AI encompasses a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and more. 
These technologies are utilized in fields such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, transportation, customer service, and many others, to automate tasks, 
make predictions, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making.

Key components of applied AI include data collection, preprocessing, algorithm selection and training, model deployment, and ongoing optimization and maintenance. 
It often involves interdisciplinary collaboration between AI specialists, domain experts, data scientists, software engineers, and other professionals to tailor 
AI solutions to the specific needs and constraints of the problem at hand.

Overall, applied AI plays a crucial role in driving innovation, improving efficiency, and unlocking new opportunities across various sectors, ultimately contributing 
to advancements in technology and society as a whole."""
